          <h2>E-News</h2>
          <p>E! News, previously known as E! News Daily and E! News Live, is the entertainment news operation for the cable network E! in the United States. Its former on-air weekday newscast debuted on September 1, 1991, and primarily reported on celebrity news and gossip, along with previews of upcoming films and television shows, regular segments about all of those three subjects, along with overall film and television industry news. Although the on-air network newscasts were discontinued in March 2020, the news operation continues to function in full through E!'s website.</p>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The program first aired on September 12, 1991.[1] It was originally hosted by Dagny Hultgreen. It features stories and gossip about celebrities as well as the film, music, and television industries. Since its launch, it has broadcast under a variety of formats, at one point even airing live during the mid-2000s (at this time, the show was named E! News Live). Starting in 2006, it was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic. In April 2012, Seacrest was replaced by Jason Kennedy. Rancic temporarily left the show on maternity leave in August 2012 due to the birth of her first son (through a surrogate), though she reassured viewers that she would return under a new three-year agreement to E! News and Fashion Police after her leave; Catt Sadler took over her anchoring duties, and eventually became a main anchor as Rancic reduced her duties over time. From 2006 until late 2010, The Daily 10, hosted by Sal Masekela, Sadler, and at one point Debbie Matenopoulos, lead out of E! News.</p>
